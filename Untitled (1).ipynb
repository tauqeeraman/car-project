The primary contributors to the database are law enforcement agencies and state agencies across the nation. This data set is interesting because it combines a wide variety of variables around motor vehicle accidents including the detailed location and time of the accident, multiple contributing factors to the accident and multiple weather and lighting factors. For the intent of this capstone project we are focusing on the states, time of year, day in the month, day of the week, the time of the day, number of vehicles and the number of fatalities.¶\nWe can use this data to help answer important questions about traffic accident deaths and ways to avoid them. For instance is there a specific time that is more dangerous? Can we predict that as more motor vehicles are involved the greater chance of a fatality? For each season what are the states with the highest fatalities?¶\nIn [0]:\n#@title\nimport numpy as np\nimport os\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport

of the data¶\nThe data is only from 2017. The Data represents the fifty states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. There were 34247 fatal incidents reported. The data is from the Nathional Highway and Transportation Safety Administration and represents one portion of their data set. I have filtered the data set variables to improve performance. You can get the full data set from NHTSA website (ftp://ftp.nhtsa.dot.gov/fars/2017/National/FARS2017NationalCSV.zip)¶\nTHe date shows that 38.5% of the incidents involved two individuals and less than 10% of fatal incidents involved more than four individuals. When it comes to the number of vehicles involved in fatal incidents 55.0% of the incidents involve a single vehicle. It is also important to note that there is as substantial gap between two vehicles (36.4%) and three vehicles (6.26%).¶\nIn [0]:\n#@title\n#create new variable combining all the people in vehicles and pedestrians\nacci['total_people'] = acci['pedestrians'] + acci['persons']\n# initial evaluation of data\n#acci['total_people'].mode()\nacci['total_people'].describe().to_frame()\npercent_people= (acci['total_people'].value_counts()/34247)*100\nprint('frequency of the number of people involved')\npercent_people.to_frame()[:10]\nfrequency of the number of people involved\nOut[0]:\ntotal_people\n2\t38.528922\n1\t26.843227\n3\t17.143107\n4\t8.085380\n5\t4.292347\n6\t2.257132\n7\t1.191345\n8\t0.674512\n9\t0.335796\n10\t0.230677\nIn [0]:\n#@title\n# initial evaluation of data\n#acci['persons'].max()\nprint ('The percentage of vehicle occupants  per incident')\nacci['total_people'].describe().to_frame()\npercent_vehicle= (acci['total_vehicles'].value_counts()/34247)*100\npercent_vehicle.to_frame()[:10]\nThe percentage of vehicle occupants  per incident\nOut[0]:\ntotal_vehicles\n1\t55.020878\n2\t36.406109\n3\t6.263322\n4\t1.471662\n5\t0.455514\n6\t0.178118\n7\t0.099279\n8\t0.032120\n9\t0.026280\n10\t0.017520\nIn [0]:\n#@title\n#viewing the variables after applying the filter\n#acci.columns.to_frame()\nLooking at how the weather relates to fatal incidents the majority of accident are occuring when the weather is clear. The second most common condition is cloudy and rain is the third most common. The absence of adverse weather is not what most would expect to lead to more accidents. To further understand this finding we may need to look at the relationship between weather and driving behavior and tendency to drive less with adverse weather conditions. We could also look at how number of fatal accidents in adverse weather for specific regions may come into play like snow and ice in Arizona and other southern states.¶\nIn [0]:\n#@title \nacci['local weather']=acci['weather1']\nweather1_sum=acci['local weather'].map(weather_id).value_counts().to_frame()\nweather1_sum.sort_index(inplace =True)\n\nweather2_sum=acci['weather2'].map(weather_id).value_counts().to_frame()\nweather2_sum.sort_index(inplace =True)\n\nweather1_sum.append(weather2_sum)\n\nweather1_sum.plot(kind='bar', color ='red', title='Reported Weather at time of accident', figsize=(20, 5), )\nplt.show()\n\nWe can also look at other contributing factors outside the weather.

However, the exact opposit is true. For 2017 the number of fatalities actually decreased (excluding some outliers). This may be related to the fact that as other drivers see the accident occuring they are slowing down to avoid the accident and in instances where one car collides with many they are not traveling very fast if at all.¶\nIn [0]:\n#@title\n#create the graphic showing the relationship between the number of vehicles and fatalities\nplt.figure(figsize=(15,5))\nsns.regplot(x=acci['total_vehicles'], y=acci['fatalities'],fit_reg=False)\nplt.ylim(0,15)\nplt.show()\n\nIn [0]:\n#@title\n#fatal_vs_vehicles = pd.crosstab(acci['total_vehicles'],acci['fatalities'])\n#plt.figure(figsize=(10,5))\n#sns.heatmap(fatal_vs_vehicles[:50], annot=True, fmt=\"d\", cmap=\"YlGnBu\")\n#sns.heatmap(fatal_vs_vehicles, annot=True, fmt=\"d\", linewidths=.8)\n#plt.yticks(rotation=0)\n#plt.xticks(rotation=0, )\n#plt.show()\nFurther Research¶\nAfter working on this data project there are a few areas I would take this project. I think it would be interesting to incoporate the age and driving experience of the drivers for the data. I also would like to explore the geographical and climate related data in regards to terrain and road temperatures. One area that also needs more attention is jurisdiction based data, county/city/state laws, speed limits, road condition. I think looking into the correlation between jurisdiction data and fatal incidents may also shine some light on why certain states and cities have higher rates of fatal accidents. As I mentioned above I would l like to also look into why specific dates had higher incidences of fatal accidents. I would also add that taking this data and expanding it to include an entire decade or all the available years while also incorporating population data and presence of specific vehicle safety technology would be helpful. Utilizing machine learning to predict the conditions that are the most likely to result in fatal accidents and to create advisories based on live data about road conditions, traffic patterns and changing weather. I think this would also be helpful for individuals looking at self driving cars as a means to identify needed algorhythm changes and also provide a means of justifying self driving cars.¶"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"name":"python3","display_name":"Python 3","language":"python"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.10","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
